  Rails is a full-stack, open-source web framework in Ruby for writing
  real-world applications.

  Being a full-stack framework means that all layers are built to work
  seamlessly together. That way you don't repeat yourself and you can
  use a single language from top to bottom. Everything from templates to
  control flow to business logic is written in Ruby.
